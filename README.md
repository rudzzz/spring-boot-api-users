<h1>Spring Boot API</h1> 

## Project description

<p align="justify">
    This is my first Spring Boot API, where you can register a new user and store it in your local database.
</p>

## How it works

<p align="justify">
    To list registered users you must make a GET request.
    To create a user you must make a POST request, and in the body pass the person's first and last name.
    Keep in mind that the users are registered in your local database so when you restart the project all users will be gone.
